		To build a full-scale quantum processor it is necessary to automate as many steps as possible on the physical, hardware level. Circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) is a contemporary architecture for dispersive readout and Purcell protection of superconducting qubits of various types, and thus it is necessary to develop software that is able to perform every kind of automatic calibration of such systems from scratch without any human participation. An important step towards this goal is to build a noise-insensitive and accurate computer vision tool to process three-dimensional spectroscopic data. In this work, we present and describe two scalable algorithms that are able to extract the Hamiltonian parameters of the cQED systems from spectroscopic data.

\section{Introduction}
Over the past twenty years, superconducting artificial atoms (SAA) were used in numerous experiments confidently demonstrating the validity of fundamental quantum mechanical laws\cite{you2011atomic}. Due to synthetic nature of SAA, their Hamiltonians can be pre-designed and engineered, and this makes them a particularly versatile tool for studies in quantum optics. Notably, their parameters may be varied in such a wide range that novel physical effects previously inaccessible for natural systems may be directly observed. For example, the strong coupling regime when the coupling strength between light and a quantum system approaches 1\% of their frequency has been a major milestone for atoms, molecules, etc and was only reached using high-finesse cavities. In contrast, superconducting quantum systems have rapidly attained this landmark using \textit{circuit QED}\cite{wallraff2004strong} just in a few years after their first discovery\cite{chiorescu2004coherent} and have already surpassed other strongly-coupled systems in terms of coherence\cite{forn2019ultrastrong}. 
Moreover, SAA do not even require confined radiation to implement strong coupling with light: they may be coupled unprecedently strong with the free-propagating EM-waves in the on-chip 1D waveguides\cite{astafiev2010resonance} without having to use cavities at all. The Rabi frequency in this case may reach 50\% of the transition frequency\cite{deng2015observation} which is already the ultra-strong coupling regime.

In general, a quantum system exposed to strong external driving can experience various quantum phenomena explained by resonant single- and multi-photon transitions between energy levels. The most known examples are coherent population trapping, electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)\cite{boller1991observation}, stimulated Raman adiabatic passage\cite{bergmann1998coherent} and Autler-Townes (A-T) splitting\cite{autler1955stark}. 

In this work, we are studying effects of light-matter interaction that occur in a system of two coupled artificial atoms: a superconducting artificial molecule (SAM). In our experiment, we use two transmons\cite{koch2007charge} interacting with each other through a cavity bus\cite{majer2007coupling}. Microwave radiation is applied to this system through a coplanar on-chip antenna and transmon states may be monitored by dispersive readout using the same coupling cavity \cite{chow2010detecting}.

It turns out that due to the strong interaction of SAM with the microwave drive, multiphoton transitions and the Autler-Townes effect are playing the crucial role in the phenomena that we have discovered. The A-T splitting has been observed before in atomic\cite{picque1976direct}, molecular systems\cite{tamarat1995pump}, quantum dots\cite{xu2007coherent}, and for SAAs as well\cite{baur2009measurement, sillanpaa2009autler, novikov2013autler, suri2013observation, peng2018vacuum}. However, the previous studies have  only involved just a single SAA and have demonstrated only the standard spectral signatures known from the quantum optics; instead, a diatomic SAM allows to observe some qualitatively new spectral manifestations of the effect. 

Remarkably, besides its fundamental value, this experiment may be useful for future quantum computers: a quantum engineer should consider the observed behaviours as unwanted, and thus careful control of the driving power must be employed to avoid them (for instance, as we will show, the bSWAP gate\cite{poletto2012entanglement} is directly affected).

In  cause of the AT effect is the dressing of the atomic levels by strong EM radiation. This dressing The new energy state called dressed states. If an additional weak probing field is applied, the spectra of the strongly driven system can be probed. In particular the dressed state model nicely explains the emergence of the Mollow triplet\cite{newstein1968spontaneous} spectrum, which consists of a central peak with two side bands separated by the Rabi frequency. 

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{intro_scheme}
	\caption{Illustrating the AT splitting in the rotating frame ($\hbar=1$ here). \textbf{(a)} The three-level system is driven strongly by a ``coupler'' tone of amplitude $\Omega$ at frequency $\omega_{01}-\Delta$. It induces Rabi oscillations between $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$ at the generalized Rabi frequency $\Omega_R = \sqrt{\Omega^2 + \Delta^2}$. \textbf{(b)} Moving to the frame rotating with the drive, we effectively change the $\ket{0}\rightarrow \ket{1}$ transition frequency to $\Delta$. However, when RWA is applied and Hamiltonian is re-diagonalized, the splitting between two lowest levels (dressed states $\ket{a}$ and $\ket{b}$) becomes $\Omega^R$. Now, the experimenter may observe a doublet transition from these levels to the state $\ket{2}$ with frequencies $\omega_{12}+(\Delta \pm \Omega^R)/2$.} 
\end{figure}

For example, the implementation of the controlled-PHASE quantum gate for typical alkali atoms (such as Rb or Cs)  is based on the effect of dressed states in conjunction with the effect of Rydberg-blockade\cite{sun2018analysis}. One of the possible way to build quantum memory with trapped atomic ions based on dressed states is described in this work\cite{timoney2011quantum}. 

A sufficiently large anharmonicity is needed to prevent qubit operations from exciting other transitions in the system. Therefore, we will use two- and three-level approximations for our calculations


In this article will be shown how the spectrum of the system depends on drivers on different qubits and explicitly shown the dressed states.%\autoref{sec:level1}
 
\section{Methods}
\subsection{Theoretical description of the system}

We investigate a system of two interacting transmons. The transmon represents two Josephson junctions (dc-SQUID) which are shunted by an additional large capacitance(compared to other capacitances in the circuit). This dc-SQUID setup allows for the tuning of the Josephson energy $E_J = E_J^{max}|\cos(\pi \frac{\Phi}{\Phi_0})|$  by
means of an external magnetic flux $\Phi$. The transmon can be considered as an oscillator with a quartic perturbation describing the leading-order anharmonicity. The system of two transmons and their connection forms a level system.

In this section we analyse theoretically two qubit system.
 In our study we used transmons.The transmon Hamiltonian is $H = 4\cdot E_C(n-n_g)^2 -E_J\cos(\phi)$, where $E_c $ and $E_J$ -charge and Josephson energy respectively. The symbols $n$ and $\phi$ denote the number of Cooper pairs transferred between the islands and the
 gauge-invariant phase difference between the superconductors,
 respectively.
 When the ratio $\frac{E_C}{E_J}$ is large the perturbation approach can
 be employed. After the expansion of the cosine for small angles and neglecting of the small terms the Hamiltonian can be
 viewed as a harmonic oscillator with a quartic perturbation describing the leading-order anharmonicity.
 After conversion to dimensionless variables and neglecting small terms and set $\hbar = 1$, we move to the new Hamiltonian of transmon. 
\begin{equation}
H_{tr}= \omega_{tr} b^{\dagger}b +\frac{1}{2}\alpha b^{\dagger}b(b^{\dagger}b-1)
\end{equation}
Where $\alpha=-E_C$, $\omega_{tr}=\sqrt{8E_CE_J}+\alpha$.


The implementations of the transitions between the eigenstates is achieved by external microwave driving through a capacitively coupled transition line. In the notations used above, the pump Hamiltonian can be written generically as $ 	H_{dr} = -2e n\beta V_{dr}(t)=\Omega(t)(b+b^{\dagger})$.
Where $2en$ -- the charge on island, $\beta$ -- dimensionless coefficient depending on the geometry of the system and the ratio of capacities, $V_{dr}(t)$ -- the voltage on the external source.

For simplifications select the dependence on time:
\begin{equation}
H_{dr} = \Omega\cos(\omega_d t)(b+b^{\dagger})
\end{equation}
Let's move on to the consideration of the two-qubit system. The complete Hamiltonian will contain the members responsible for transmons, the drives on each of them separately with frequencies $\omega_d$ and $\omega_d+\delta_{\omega}$ respectively, and the interaction term between qubits:
\begin{equation}\label{Hsystem}
H_{system}= H_{tr1}+H_{tr2}+H_{dr1}+H_{dr2}+H_{int}
\end{equation}
Where $H_{int}= J(bc^{\dagger}+b^{\dagger}c)$, $b^{\dagger}$;$b$ and $c^{\dagger}$,$c$ - denote the regular annihilation and creation operators
for the harmonic oscillator approximating both of qubits respectively.



\begin{figure*}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{main_scheme}
	\caption{Explaining the origin of the AT satellites. \textbf{(a)} System level structure at 3.65 mA. At this current, the first transmon (orange) is below the second one (blue) exactly by $\alpha/2$ ($\omega_2 - \omega_1 = \alpha/2$), and thus $E_{02} - E_{10} = \hbar\omega_1$. Since $E_{12} - E_{02} = \omega_1$ as well, both $00\rightarrow 10$, two-photon $00 \rightarrow 02/2$ and three-photon $00\rightarrow 12/3$ transitions can occur around the same frequency of $\omega_1$. During the two-tone spectroscopy, the first transmon is driven by a strong signal of amplitude $\Omega_1$ (possibly, at a small detuning $\Delta_1$ from $\omega_1$ shown in green). The transmon-transmon interaction in RWA conserves the number of excitations and is depicted as orange-blue circles. \textbf{(b)} Moving to the frame rotating with the drive of the first transmon, we make all the states $\ket{0j},\ket{1j}$ nearly degenerate (in fact, now the first transmon splitting equals $\Delta_1$). However, the presence of a strong excitation lifts the degeneracy and the splitting changes to $\Omega_1^R = \sqrt{\Omega_1^2 + \Delta_1^2}$ (the first transmon becomes light-dressed). \textbf{(c)} Transitions in the light-dressed system when the second qubit is excited (level subspaces coupled by the corresponding drive operator are shown as blue ellipses). In the left part of the panel, all possible two-photon transitions near $\omega_1$ are depicted. The structure of the levels gives rise to three cases: the green transitions are not shifted in frequency, the orange are red-shifted by $\Omega_R^1/2$ and the blue are blue-shifted by $\Omega_R^2/2$. However, as shown in the right part of the panel, without the transmon-transmon interaction the satellite transitions are forbidden due the selection rule: $\bra{a,j}\hat{\mathbbm{1}}\otimes \hat n_2 \ket{b, j+1} = 0$ since $\braket{a}{b} = 0$. When the coupling equals $J$, the dispersive approximation yields $\bra{a,j}\hat{\mathbbm{1}}\otimes \hat n_2\ket{b, j+1}\propto J^2/(\omega_1-\omega_2)^2$ and the satellites become visible. Remarkably, due to the two-photon nature of the transitions, the Autler-Townes splitting in this case will be two $\Omega_1^R$.}

\subsubsection{Experimental parameters}
\subsubsection{Experimental setup}
The sample was measured in laboratory of artificial quantum systems at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. Cryogenic equipment was
represented by BlueFors LD250 dilution refrigerator, with base temperature of 16 mK. The microwave equipment included KEYSIGHT PNA-L N5232A 300 kHz-20 GHz vector network analyser, Agilent MXG N5183B 9 kHz - 40 GHz analog signal generator. The sample was 
flux biased using YOKOGAWA GS200 current source.

Microwave line was thermalized with 60 dB of attenuation, additional 20 dB of attenuation were introduced on a directional coupler which added the second tone from the $\mu$-wave source. After leaving the sample the signal passed through two isolators and a hybrid coupler. Finally, the signal was amplified with 4-8 GHz LNF amplifier at 4 K and a with a room-temperature amplifier.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Theoretical description of AF}
Let's consider our system (\autoref{Hsystem}) in rotating frame. Moving to this frame is achieved by the rotation:
\begin{equation}
R = \exp(-i\omega_d t (b^{\dagger}b+c^{\dagger}c))
\end{equation}  
After this transformation the effective Hamiltonian can be found from equation:
\begin{equation}
H_{system}^R = R^{\dagger}H_{system}R-iR^{\dagger}\dot{R}
\end{equation}

From the simulation follows that a two-level approximation for first qubit and three-level approximation for second is sufficient to observe the effect we are interested in. The Hamiltonian in matrix form is given by the following expression:
\begin{widetext}
	\begin{equation}\label{matrix} 
	\text{$H^R$} = \left(\begin{matrix}
	0 & \text{$\Omega_1/2 $} & \text{$\Omega _2$} e^{i \text{$\delta_{\omega}$} t}/2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
	\text{$\Omega_1/2 $} & \text{$-\Delta_1 $} & J & \text{$\Omega_2$} e^{i \text{$\delta_{\omega}$} t}/2 & 0 & 0 \\
	\text{$\Omega_2$} e^{-i \text{$\delta_{\omega} $} t}/2 & J & -\text{$\Delta_2 $} &
	\text{$\Omega_1$/2} & \sqrt{2} \text{$\Omega_2$} e^{i \text{$\delta_{\omega}$} t}/2 & 0 \\
	0 & \text{$\Omega_2$} e^{-i \text{$\delta_{\omega} $} t}/2 & \text{$\Omega_1/2$} &
	\text{$-\Delta_2 -\Delta_1$} & \sqrt{2} J & \sqrt{2} \text{$\Omega_2$} e^{i \text{$\delta_{\omega}
			$} t}/2 \\
	0 & 0 & \sqrt{2} \text{$\Omega_2$} e^{-i \text{$\delta_{\omega}$} t}/2 & \sqrt{2} J &
	\text{$\alpha$}-2 \text{$\Delta_2$} & \text{$\Omega_1/2$} \\
	0 & 0 & 0 & \sqrt{2} \text{$\Omega_2$} e^{-i \text{$\delta_{\omega} $} t}/2 & \text{$\Omega_1/2
		$} & \text{$\alpha$}-2 \text{$\Delta_2$}- \text{$\Delta_1$} \\
	\end{matrix}\right)
	\end{equation}
\end{widetext}
Where $\Omega_1$, $\Omega_2$ - amplitudes of the drives, $\Delta_1 = \omega_d-\omega_{tr1}=0$,$\Delta_2 = \omega_d-\omega_{tr2}$.
Let's consider the Hamiltonian (\autoref{matrix}) in details. Divide it into three parts: time-dependent $(V_t)$, the part responsible for the interaction between the qubits $(V_J)$ and all the rest $(H_0)$.
\begin{equation}
	H^R=H_0+V_J+V_t
\end{equation}
The $\Omega_1\gg \Omega_2,\Delta_2\gg J$, so the driven field on the first qubit is strong and form the dressed states defined by the Hamiltonian $H_0$.
The Hamiltonian $H_0$ is station and we can find eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The drive on the second qubit is weak with very low intensity, so we can neglect any perturbation introduced by second drive on the position, width os the dressed states.
Firstly, we consider the system of non-interacting qubits $(J=0)$. In this case some transitions are prohibited and the splitting we are interested in is not observed. 
Therefore a non-zero interaction between qubits is necessary to observe AT effect.

After that according to the perturbation theory (with perturbation $V_J$) to $H_0$ we found the first-order corrections to the wave functions. We can use Fermi Golden Rule to find the probability of transition.
